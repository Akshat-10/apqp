# APQP Timeline Chart Module

## What is APQP? (Definition)

**APQP (Advanced Product Quality Planning)** is a structured methodology for defining and executing the steps necessary to ensure that a product meets customer expectations. It is widely used in automotive and manufacturing industries to achieve robust planning, prevent quality problems, and ensure on-time launch.

## About the APQP Timeline Chart Module

The **APQP Timeline Chart Module** for Odoo 16 is a custom addon that centralizes and streamlines APQP phase tracking, document management, and project monitoring using visual, interactive timeline charts. This module enhances your Odoo with:
- End-to-end visibility for all APQP phases and formats.
- Easy management, monitoring, and reporting of progress for every document package.
- Automation and synchronization between phases, formats, attachments, and review steps.

**Module Details:**

- **Technical Name:** `apqp`
- **Version:** 16.0.1.0+
- **Category:** Project Management / Quality / Manufacturing
- **License:** LGPL-3 (implied)
- **Author:** Your Company

## Dependencies

This module requires the following Odoo modules:

- `base` - Odoo core module
- `xf_doc_approval` - Document approval management
- `iatf` - IATF standards compliance
- `mail` - Email and messaging functionality
- `hr` - Human resources
- `product` - Product management
- `board` - Dashboard functionality

## Key Features & Functionalities

### 1. APQP Timeline Chart Management
- Auto-creation of timeline charts per document package.
- Charts pull relevant dates, part/customer info, and document types (Safe Launch, Prototype, etc) right from the package.
- Visual Gantt-like chart and timeline HTML with phase grouping, color-coded status, and metrics (% progress, actual vs. target).

### 2. APQP Phases
- Fully customizable set of phases (add/modify via configuration menu).
- Each phase supports color, description, and ordering/sequence.
- Phases are referenced throughout timeline, attachments, and formats.

### 3. Timeline Formats & Templates
- Add format lines to timeline, grouping by phase.
- Drag-and-drop to reorder or regroup timeline entries by phase.
- **Format Template Management**: Reusable templates for rapid chart creation. Define typical formats/steps per phase and apply to new timelines automatically.

### 4. Document Attachment Management
- Attach files to timeline entries directly (with drag-and-drop multi-upload support).
- Attachments sync bi-directionally: update one side, timeline format reflects changes; remove an attachment, the entry is smartly cleaned.
- Tracks count/availability of all related attachments.

### 5. Minutes of Meeting (MOM) Integration
- Dedicated MOM Formats (see new menu!) to log open points, responsibilities, due/actual dates, attendees, and approval.
- State workflow (draft, in progress, completed, approved, cancelled) with complete state history.
- Grouping and reporting on MOM per timeline/project/phase.

### 6. Open Points (New Model & Menu)
- Centralize all outstanding action points relevant to APQP/MOM.
- Assign to responsible parties; track status; ensure nothing is missed in the quality plan.

### 7. Menu Structure (Navigation)
- **APQP** (root menu)
   - **Timeline Charts**: Your main projects and their timelines.
   - **MOM Formats**: Manage, review and approve minutes of meeting formats.
   - **Timeline Attachments**: Mass-manage all attachments across charts.
   - **Configuration:**
     - **Phases**, **Format Templates**, **Open Points**: Full admin power over reference/config data.

### 8. Reporting & Views
- Tree and form views for all major entities (charts, formats, MOMs, open points, attachments, templates).
- Rich search/group by (by phase, by project, status, date, and more).

### 9. Security & Role Based Access
- Granular control: limit certain actions to system users/admins, and basic tracking for business users.
- Full Chatter and Odoo mail integration for tracking, notes, and communication.

### 10. Customization & Automation
- All key models are extensible via standard Odoo inheritance.
- Context-aware syncs prevent recursion/loops.
- Computed fields for status, progress, colorization, etc.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:

   - Ensure all dependent modules are installed
   - Odoo 16.0 or compatible version
2. **Installation Steps**:

   ```bash
   # Copy module to custom addons directory
   cp -r apqp /path/to/odoo/custom-addons/

   # Update module list
   ./odoo-bin -u apqp -d your_database
   ```
3. **Initial Configuration**:

   - Configure APQP phases via Settings â†’ Technical â†’ APQP Phases
   - Set up user permissions as needed

## Usage Guide

### Creating Timeline Charts

1. Navigate to a Document Package
2. Timeline Chart is auto-created upon package creation
3. Access via smart button or menu

### Managing Attachments

1. Open Timeline Chart form
2. Add attachments in the Attachments tab
3. Specify:
   - Phase (dropdown selection)
   - Format Name (free text)
   - Planned dates
   - Reference information
4. Save to trigger automatic sync

### Tracking Progress

1. Update actual start/end dates in timeline formats
2. Status automatically updates based on dates
3. Overall progress percentage shown on timeline chart

### Viewing Timeline Overview

1. Click "Timeline Overview" button
2. Review HTML table with all phases and formats
3. Use "Refresh Timeline" for manual updates

## Technical Details

### Inheritance Structure

- `apqp.timeline.chart` inherits `mail.thread` and `mail.activity.mixin`
- Document models inherit from base document approval module

### Computed Fields

- **Progress**: Calculated as (completed formats / total formats) Ã— 100
- **Status**: Determined by comparing actual vs planned dates
- **Timeline HTML**: Generated dynamically with embedded CSS

### Context Flags

- `skip_sync`: Prevents recursive synchronization
- `from_attachment_sync`: Identifies sync source
- `group_by_phase`: Default grouping in views

## Customization

### Adding New Phases

1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Technical â†’ APQP Phases
2. Create new phase with name and sequence
3. Existing timelines automatically include new phase

### Modifying Status Colors

Edit CSS in `_compute_timeline_html` method:

```css
.status-completed { background-color: #d4edda; }
.status-in_progress { background-color: #fff3cd; }
.status-delayed { background-color: #f8d7da; }
```

### Extending Fields

Inherit models to add custom fields:

```python
class APQPTimelineChartCustom(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'apqp.timeline.chart'
  
    custom_field = fields.Char('Custom Field')
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Attachments not syncing**

   - Check if `skip_sync` context is set
   - Verify phase_id and format_name are filled
   - Ensure user has proper permissions
2. **Timeline overview not updating**

   - Use manual refresh button
   - Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
   - Verify computed field dependencies
3. **Phase changes not reflecting**

   - Ensure drag-and-drop handle is visible
   - Check sequence field permissions
   - Verify bidirectional sync is enabled

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```python
import logging
_logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Data Entry**

   - Always specify phase before format name
   - Use consistent format naming conventions
   - Set planned dates before actual dates
2. **Performance**

   - Limit attachments per timeline format
   - Use batch operations for multiple updates
   - Archive completed timelines
3. **Maintenance**

   - Regular cleanup of orphaned attachments
   - Periodic review of phase sequences
   - Monitor sync performance

## Version History
